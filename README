# Site Scraper

## Description

This is for scrapping a dynamic word press site and making a static web site. 

Static site hosting is much cheaper and quicker than hosting a word press site. The idea is to host a website locally and use this to create a static site which is hosted externally  on a server. 

This uses `wget` to make a copy of the site assets, then uses `sed` to correct any hard coded links 

### Requirments

`apt-get install wget`

`sudo apt install sed`

## Variables

The script uses two variables:

- `IP_ADDRESS`: The IP address of the website to scrape.
- `SITE_NAME`: The name of the site.

These variables are defined at the top of the script. To change the IP address or site name, modify the values of these variables

## Known Problems

Any features requiring server processing won't work
